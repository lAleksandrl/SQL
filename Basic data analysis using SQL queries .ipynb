    "## Final recommendations:\n",
    "1. Pay attention to the work of manager Michael Albert. Under his leadership there are employees whose quality of work leaves much to be desired.\n",
    "2. Based on data from Study 4:\n",
    "     - For the IT department, hire more employees, hire a good manager, so as not to overload employees with overtime work;\n",
    "     - Create a career elevator within the company for production personnel;\n",
    "3. Based on data from Study 7:\n",
    "     - Another pointer to the fact that it is necessary to work out issues with the IT department: it is in first place in terms of “staff turnover”\n",
    "4. In the production department, the following are candidates for dismissal: see Study 12\n",
    "5. According to data from Study 13, it is clear that attracting talent through Careerbuilder and Pay Per Click resources can be stopped. These are the most expensive sources in terms of unit costs. Specialists (Production Technician I, Production Technician II) can be found through Search Engine - Google Bing Yahoo and Newspager/Magazine, through which they are much more likely to be found. + consider Social Networks as a candidate for termination of funding, since the channel is also ineffective.\n",
    "6. Money from reducing funding for ineffective channels should be used for additional funding of top channels by department. The study shows the direction to which specific channels finance can be directed, for example, if it is advertising vacancies and payment, for example, for impressions or for places in search results. Fine-tuning this funding can be done using the table in Study 15.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tools for recruiting:\n",
    "     - Table from Study 2 - correspondence between the position and statistically the most popular job resource.\n",
    "     - Tables from Study 3:\n",
    "             - correspondence between the vacancy resource and average work experience\n",
    "             - Correspondence between the vacancy resource and average age\n",
    "             - correspondence between the vacancy resource and the percentage of genders\n",
    "     - Table from Study 8: Distribution by gender among departments.\n",
    "     - Table from Study 9: Distribution of average age and salary by department.\n",
    "## Tools for management decisions with existing personnel:\n",
    "     - The tables from Study 5 can be used as a guide if there is a need to rotate managers between departments.\n",
    "     - The table from Study 6 can help create quality targets by department\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Inferences:\n",
    "  - Judging by Study 10, the average “staff turnover” rate for the company is average, which is generally good, but there is room for improvement. Again, it can get bigger by fixing problems in the IT department.\n",
    "  - The company is quite young (according to the average age of the employee) - 30-35 years old - the largest age group\n",
    "  - According to data from Study 16, we see that the average real average salary by division is almost halfway between the average average salary and the average maximum salary by division. This is good, because it means that the company’s managers have room to optimize wage costs, as well as a small gap to increase the wage fund, if necessary."
